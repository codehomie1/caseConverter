<h1>Case Converter Project</h1>
<p>
This is a simple web app that allows users to 
change their font sizes to different cases without having to rewrite their entire text
</p>


<h2>Stage 1 : Web App layout <h2>
<p>This is the page layout simple: nothing much to describe</p>
<p>I will have to work on making this page more responsive but this will do for now</p>


<h2> Stage 2: Implement Btn Functions</h2>
<p>In this stage I am working on implementing each of the buttons functions</p>
<p>This is done with the help of event listeners and string methods.</p>
